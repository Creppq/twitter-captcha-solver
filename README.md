When setting up a Twitter account, FunCaptcha uses two distinct site-keys. 
- The first, 867D55F2-24FD-4C56-AB6D-589EDAF5E7C5, is used for mobile operating systems like iOS, Android, etc. 
- The second, 2CB16598-CB82-4CF7-B332-5990DB66F3AB, is for desktop operating systems such as Windows OS, Ubuntu, MacOS, and more. 

Additionally, if an account becomes locked, Twitter employs a different site-key, 0152B4EB-D2DC-460A-89A1-629838B529C9, to facilitate the unlocking process through a challenge.
